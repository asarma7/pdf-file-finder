Q2: What do these documents say about Ghislaine Maxwell’s scheduling / coordination activities

Hybrid: Based on the provided excerpts, it appears that Ghislaine Maxwell was involved in scheduling and coordination activities, particularly in relation to her legal case. Here are some specific findings:

1. Scheduling notifications: On September 16, 2020, a scheduling notification was filed in the case of United States v. Maxwell, setting deadlines for Ghislaine Maxwell's brief and joint appendix (EFTA00025378.pdf p.1).
2. Coordination with the Maxwell team: In December 2020, the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (USANYS) coordinated with the Maxwell team to confirm the accuracy of certain documents (EFTA00023074.pdf p.2).
3. Disparities in counsel and discovery access: In December 2020, the USANYS team discussed disparities in counsel and discovery access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera, and prepared a letter and declaration on the issue (EFTA00023074.pdf p.2).
4. Email correspondence: In January 2020, Teri Gibbs of the USANYS team exchanged emails with an unknown recipient, discussing the sharing of documents and email correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell (EFTA00032225.pdf p.2).
5. Scheduling of meetings: In January 2020, Teri Gibbs scheduled a meeting with an unknown recipient for January 23, 2020, at 12 PM PST/3 PM EST (EFTA00032225.pdf p.2).

Overall, the provided excerpts suggest that Ghislaine Maxwell was involved in various scheduling and coordination activities, particularly in relation to her legal case. However, the extent and nature of these activities are not fully clear from the provided excerpts.

Semantic: Based on the provided excerpts, it appears that Ghislaine Maxwell's scheduling/coordination activities are mentioned in the following documents:

1. EFTA00032225.pdf (p.2): This document mentions that Ghislaine Maxwell's team has provided authorization to share a list of office numbers used during her employment with Ghislaine Maxwell from 2003-2007.
2. EFTA00023074.pdf (p.2): This document mentions that the Maxwell team has reviewed the documents and found them to be accurate and would not present issues in their case if filed.
3. EFTA00025378.pdf (p.1): This document mentions a "So-Ordered Scheduling Notification" that sets a deadline for Ghislaine Maxwell to file a brief and joint appendix.
4. EFTA00024494.pdf (p.1) and EFTA00024470.pdf (p.1): These documents mention a "final report" with changes attached, which was sent to the U.S. Pretrial Services Officer Specialist - Intake Coordinator.

However, there is no direct evidence in the provided excerpts that Ghislaine Maxwell was actively involved in scheduling or coordination activities. The documents seem to be related to legal proceedings and communication between parties involved in the case.

Summary: The provided excerpts suggest that Ghislaine Maxwell's scheduling/coordination activities are mentioned in the context of legal proceedings, but there is no direct evidence of her involvement in such activities.
